## Hi, I'm Starry
![Profile view counter on GitHub](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=starryband)

My name is Starry, and I like JavaScript (I can code in TypeScript too), C#, and lacrosse.
I used to work in the SCP: SL plugin development community a bit, but now I kinda do my own thing.

I don't publish many projects or really work on GitHub right now.
